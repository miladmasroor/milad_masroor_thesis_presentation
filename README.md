The presentation of master thesis

In my research, titled "Long-term Production Forecasting Using Multivariate Time Series Analysis and a Novel Residual 3D-CNN LSTM Model," I embarked on the intricate task of forecasting field production in water-flooding reservoirs. Recognizing the inherent complexities of this endeavor, I introduced a sophisticated yet cost-efficient methodology underpinned by multivariable time series (MTS) analysis.

To implement this technique, I harnessed injection and production datasets, converting them into artificial 3D feature images. These images facilitated a profound MTS analysis, deciphering interaction laws and pinpointing dependencies between injector and producer flow dynamics. Armed with this insight, I pioneered a deep learning model tailored for robust production prediction.

A standout feature of my research was the inception of the Residual 3D-CNN LSTM model. Merging the strengths of convolutional long short-term memory neural networks, I integrated deeper and residual bottleneck structures, setting this model apart. For validation, I juxtaposed its performance against a standard deep LSTM model, which leveraged numerical production/injection data. My Residual 3D-CNN LSTM model demonstrated superior efficacy, surpassing traditional deep LSTM models in every performance metric.

Furthermore, my research underscored the importance of principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. This technique emerged as pivotal in streamlining problem dimensions and fine-tuning the training phase. The incorporation of enhancements, like residual and deeper bottleneck configurations, also markedly accelerated the training trajectory.
